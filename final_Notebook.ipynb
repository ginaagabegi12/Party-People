    "## Introduction\n",
    "For our project, we wanted to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by using our custom metrics. For our metric, we wanted to look at the best neighborhood for community-based fun. Our approach was for each of us to look through each of the WPRDC data sets and then collaborate to choose which datasets seemed like the most fit for this metric. Some alternatives included best neighborhood for public safety, best neighborhoods for greenery, and best neighborhoods for less traffic.\n",
